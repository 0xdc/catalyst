"""
Spec file format:

The spec file format is a very simple and easy-to-use format for storing data. Here's an example
file:

item1: value1
item2: foo bar oni
item3:
	meep
	bark
	gleep moop

This file would be interpreted as defining three items: item1, item2 and item3. item1 would contain
the string value "value1". Item2 would contain an ordered list [ "foo", "bar", "oni" ]. item3
would contain an ordered list as well: [ "meep", "bark", "gleep", "moop" ]. It's important to note
that the order of multiple-value items is preserved, but the order that the items themselves are
defined are not preserved. In other words, "foo", "bar", "oni" ordering is preserved but "item1"
"item2" "item3" ordering is not, as the item strings are stored in a dictionary (hash).
